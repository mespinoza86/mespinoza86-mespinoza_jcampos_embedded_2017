Yocto

The recipes with the app and the driver are stored in the path:
recipes-app
recipes-kernel

It is required to copy those recipes in the folder meta-tec.
When the recipes-app and recipes-kernel are stored in the meta-tec folder you can compile the Yocto using:

bitbake meta-tec-image

It will create the Yocto image required.

Convolution tool

Description: 
Convolution tool is used to apply different kernels to an image.
This application will use a driver to do a convolution operation. 

You need to run the script gen_conv.sh stored in the /usr/ path to have the driver required set.

Execution
conv can be executed from the /home/root path.
The sample image is stored in the path /usr/lena512.bmp
The script gen_conv.sh is stored in the path /usr/gen_conv.sh

The instructions to execute the app are the following:

	Usage: ./conv [OPTIONS]
		Where OPTIONS are:
           -a: It shows the program autor information                                     \n");
	   -h: It shows this help menu                                                    
	   -i: It receive the source image to apply the kernel                            
	   -k: It is the kernel to apply to the image, one of the follows can be applied: 
	            1: kernel_left_sobel                                                  
	            2: kernel_identity                                                    
	            3: kernel_outline                                                     
	            4: kernel_sharpen                                                     
	            5: kernel_topsobel                                                    
	   -o: It receive the name for the output image with the kernel applied           
	                                                                                  
Command line examples:
	Before to execute the application, it is required to set the driver.
	It is required to source the file gen_conv.sh:
	
	source /usr/gen_conv.sh
	
	It will set the driver required to execute the app and make the convolution sucessfully. 
	In the /usr/ folder there is an image called lena512.bmp which can be used to validate the program. 
	  ./conv -i lena512.bmp -o result.bmp -m 1                                       
	  ./conv -i lena512.bmp -o result.bmp -m 2                                        
	  ./conv -i lena512.bmp -o result.bmp -m 3                                       
	  ./conv -i lena512.bmp -o result.bmp -m 4
